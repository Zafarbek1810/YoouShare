SERVICE COSTS AND PAYMENT PROCEDURE</title>5.1. The cost of services under this Agreement is determined as a license fee for using the Application during the rental period of the Charging Device, as well as a fee for the use and possession of the Charging Device in accordance with the selected tariff.\n5.2. The license fee is included in the rental cost of the Charging Device, i.e., the license fee is part of the Charging Device rental cost.\n5.3. The amount of the license fee, the cost of renting the Charging Device, and the payment procedure are regulated by this Agreement and the current tariffs posted in the Application and displayed in the receipt.\n5.4. The Licensor may unilaterally change tariffs, notifying Users through their profile in the “YOOU power” Application or otherwise. Changes made do not apply to active orders.\n5.5. The User must independently monitor tariff changes. The risk of not knowing about tariff changes is borne by the User. In case of disagreement with changes to the license fee or the cost of using the Charging Device (rental), the User must cease using the “YOOU power” Platform. Continued use of the Charging Device after changes are made is considered the User’s agreement with the new conditions.\n5.6. The exact cost per minute, half-hour, hour, day, week, month, half-year, or other rental time interval is determined in accordance with the tariffs specified in the Application and/or at the Station.\n5.7. By entering into an agreement to use the “YOOU power” Application and accepting the Offer terms, the User consents to the automatic deduction of funds from their account (bank card) to pay for the use of the “YOOU power” Application, rental of Charging Devices, fines, penalties, and other payments stipulated by the Agreement. The User acknowledges that instructions to deduct funds from their account (bank card) issued under this Offer clause are their own instructions, and the actions of the processing center and acquiring bank aimed at deducting funds under this Offer clause are performed with the User’s consent.\n5.8. By registering in the Application and accepting the Agreement terms, the User agrees that, in the absence of sufficient funds on the linked card, the debt may be deducted from any other bank card registered in their name, even if it is not linked to the Application.\n5.9. The deduction of funds (license fee for using the Application, payment for renting the Charging Device, and amounts of fines and penalties) under this Offer clause is carried out automatically upon meeting the following conditions:\n• The User enters bank card details during registration;\n• Automatic activation of the service for deducting funds from the User’s bank card upon the first payment;\n• The User confirms the payment by pressing the “Pay” button, which constitutes consent to the deduction of funds.\n5.10. The Licensor is entitled to verify the validity of the User’s bank card by blocking and unblocking an amount on the bank card account not exceeding the amount specified in clause 8.2 of the Agreement, or by other methods provided in the “YOOU power” Application and compliant with the legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan.\nIf there are insufficient funds on the card for renting the Charging Device, issuance of the device may be declined. All payments under the Agreement are made by deducting funds from the User’s bank card, the details of which are provided by the User in the Application. Such payments do not require additional confirmation from the User.\nIn the case of renting a Charging Device with a free trial period, no funds are deducted if the Charging Device is returned on time. If the system erroneously deducts funds after a timely return, the Licensor undertakes to refund this amount following the User’s request to the Support Service. The time for crediting funds to the User’s bank card account depends on the rules of the relevant internet acquiring system and the regulations of the organization servicing the User’s bank card account.\n5.11. If the User lacks sufficient funds to cover the debt, the Licensor may deduct the required amount from any other bank card of the User, even if it is not linked to the Application.\n5.12. In case of insufficient funds on all of the User’s bank cards at the time of deduction:\n• Access to renting the Charging Device may be restricted;\n• The debt remains the User’s responsibility and must be settled once funds become available;\n• If payment is not made within 24 hours, information about the debt may be transferred to the card-issuing bank or a collection agent;\n• If payment is absent for more than 15 calendar days, information about the debt may be submitted to a court for recovery in accordance with the procedure established by law.\n5.13. Payments are accepted from bank cards supporting internet payments. The User undertakes to maintain a sufficient balance on the card to cover rental and other payments. Payment for services is made through the payment systems specified in the Application or directly through the “YOOU power” Application. The User agrees to the acquiring conditions before making a payment.\n5.14. If the User fails to provide correct bank card details with a positive balance at the start of using the “YOOU power” Platform, the Licensor may refuse to provide the User with the Charging Device for use (rental) or issue the Charging Device with subsequent deduction of the debt from the User’s bank card.\n5.15. Payment of the license fee and rental of the Charging Device is made in advance unless otherwise specified in the “YOOU power” Application.\n5.16. The User undertakes to independently monitor information about the status and use of the “YOOU power” Application in their profile.\n5.17. Following the deduction of funds from the User’s bank card, the “YOOU power” Application provides the User with a document confirming the completed payment.\n5.18. In case of inability to deduct payment due to insufficient funds on the bank card, incorrect entry of bank card details, expiration of the bank card, or other reasons, the Licensor notifies the User of this through a message in their profile. The Licensor may inform the User of the need to pay the debt for using the Charging Device using the phone number provided during registration.\n5.19. The User is charged a debt for using the Charging Device until its return, in the manner established in Clause 8.4 of this Agreement.\n5.20. The Licensor may deduct the accrued debt amount from the User’s bank card once the User eliminates factors preventing the deduction of funds – as funds become available on the User’s card, as well as at any time before the User returns the Charging Device.\n5.21. If the User does not eliminate obstacles to payment within 24 hours from the moment of notification about the inability to deduct payment, the Licensor may terminate the Agreement and end the rental by blocking the User’s access to the Application and restricting the ability to obtain another Charging Device subsequently.\n5.22. If the User returns the Charging Device before the end of the paid usage period, no automatic recalculation is performed.\n5.23. The rental continues until the Charging Device is returned or the order is closed through the Support Service.\n5.24.  The Licensor may use intermediaries to accept payments, which does not affect the User’s payment obligations.\n\n <title>6. EFFECT OF THE AGREEMENT </title> 6.1. The Agreement is concluded for an indefinite period. \n6.2. When the User deletes their account, the Agreement is terminated.\n 6.3. Termination of the Agreement ends the obligations of the Parties under the Agreement for the future, except for provisions regarding the liability of the Parties (including, but not limited to, compensation for damages and payment of penalties), settlements between the Parties, applicable law and dispute resolution procedures, confidentiality and rights to intellectual property objects, refund of the advance amount (if applicable), as well as other provisions that, by their nature, remain in force after the termination of the primary obligation.\n6.4. The maximum rental period is 72 hours from the moment the Charging Device is received from the Station. The moment of rental termination is considered the return of the Charging Device to the Station or closure of the order through the Support Service.\n6.5. Loss of the Charging Device by the User constitutes a breach of the Agreement, for which the Licensor may terminate the Agreement by blocking the User’s access to the Application and apply the liability measures provided for in the Agreement.\n\n <title> 7. OTHER RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES </title>7.1. In case of loss of access to the Application or if there are grounds to believe that access to the Application has been obtained by a third party, the User must contact the Support Service by phone or email with a request to block access to the Personal Account. Risks associated with failure to fulfill this obligation are borne by the User. \n7.2. The User must immediately (no later than 1 (one) calendar day) notify the Licensor of the loss and/or damage of the Charging Device. In case of failure to fulfill this obligation, the Licensor may demand compensation from the User for the cost of the Charging Device, regardless of the reasons and circumstances of its loss or damage.\n7.3. The Licensor may assign its rights to collect debts from the User to any third parties without the User’s additional consent and without prior notification to the User.\n7.4. The Licensor may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any third parties without the User’s additional consent and without prior notification to the User. \n\n <title>8. LIABILITY OF THE PARTIES </title> 8.1. If the User provides inaccurate information, threatens or insults the Licensor’s employees, violates the terms of this Offer or the legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan, fails to fulfill or improperly fulfills obligations to pay the license fee and rent for the Charging Device, does not return it, or unlawfully retains it, the Licensor may restrict access to the “YOOU power” Platform. The restriction may take the form of blocking the User’s Profile or prohibiting the rental of the Charging Device until the violations are rectified. \nBlocking of the Profile may be applied under the following circumstances: \n• If the Licensor has reasonable suspicions of dishonest actions by the User (including, but not limited to, providing false data, inability to deduct payments, and other cases); \n• In case of the User’s non-compliance with the terms of the Agreement or the rules for using the Application;\n• If the User has unpaid debt; \n• In case of rude or offensive behavior by the User towards the Licensor’s representatives, or use of obscene language when communicating with the Support Service;\n• If the User attempted to mislead the Licensor, distort facts, or provide inaccurate information; \n• If a violation of the Agreement terms disrupts the Platform’s operation, hinders its use by other Users, causes damage to the Licensor, or precludes the possibility of further providing services to a specific User.\nBlocking the Profile means restricting access to the Platform’s functionality, as a result of which the User will be unable to rent a Charging Device or perform other previously available actions. \nNo separate notification of blocking is sent, as the inability to use the Platform serves as sufficient evidence of restricted access. \nUnblocking is possible after the expiration of the designated period, fulfillment of the User’s obligations, elimination of the reasons for blocking, or compliance with other requirements set by the Licensor. The decision to unblock the profile is made at the Licensor’s discretion. \n8.2. In case of damage, loss, or alteration of the appearance of the Charging Device (including affixing stickers, inscriptions, or other structural changes), the User is obliged to compensate for the caused damage. In this case, a penalty for loss is debited from the User’s bank card in the amount specified in the “YOOU power” Application as the current amount at the time of concluding the Rental, as well as the rental fee for 3 days of use of the Charging Device, calculated based on the current daily rate specified in the Application at the time of concluding the Rental. \n8.3. The use of the Charging Device for entrepreneurial or other commercial purposes is prohibited.
